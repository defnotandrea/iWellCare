# Dashboard Notifications System for iWellCare

## Overview

The dashboard notifications system provides patients with real-time updates about their appointments directly in their patient dashboard. When staff confirm, cancel, or update appointments, patients will see these notifications immediately without needing to check their email.

## How It Works

### 1. **Dual Notification System**
- **Email Notifications**: Traditional email confirmations (as before)
- **Dashboard Notifications**: Real-time updates visible in patient dashboard
- **SMS Notifications**: Ready for future SMS integration

### 2. **Notification Types**
- **Appointment Booked** (Blue) - When appointment is initially created
- **Appointment Confirmed** (Green) - When staff confirms appointment
- **Appointment Cancelled** (Red) - When appointment is cancelled
- **Appointment Rescheduled** (Yellow) - When appointment time/date changes
- **Appointment Reminder** (Purple) - For upcoming appointment reminders

### 3. **Notification Content**
Each notification includes:
- **Title**: Clear status message
- **Message**: Detailed description
- **Doctor Name**: Who the appointment is with
- **Date & Time**: When the appointment is scheduled
- **Action Button**: Relevant action (View Details, Book New, etc.)
