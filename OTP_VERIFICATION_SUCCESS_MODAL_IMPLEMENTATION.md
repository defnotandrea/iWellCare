## Files Modified

### 1. Controller: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/OtpVerificationController.php`
**Changes Made:**
- Updated the `verifyOtp` method to return JSON response with `showModal: true` flag
- Enhanced success message to be more descriptive
- Maintained backward compatibility with regular form submissions

**Key Code:**
```php
if ($request->expectsJson()) {
    return response()->json([
        'success' => true,
        'message' => 'Email verified successfully! Your account has been activated. You can now log in to continue.',
        'redirect' => $redirectUrl,
        'showModal' => true
    ]);
}
```

### 2. View: `resources/views/auth/verify-otp-simple.blade.php`
**Changes Made:**
- Added JavaScript for AJAX form submission
- Implemented `showSuccessModal()` function
- Implemented `showError()` function for error notifications
- Added loading states and form validation
- Included modal utilities script

**Key Features:**
- **AJAX Form Handling:** Prevents default form submission and uses fetch API
- **Loading States:** Shows spinner and disables button during verification
- **Success Modal:** Beautiful modal with success message and redirect button
- **Error Handling:** Toast notifications for errors with auto-dismiss
- **Auto-redirect:** Automatically redirects to login page after 3 seconds

### 3. JavaScript Functions

#### `showSuccessModal(message, redirectUrl)`

- Auto-redirects after 3 seconds

#### `showError(message)`
- Creates toast notification for errors

## User Flow

1. **User enters OTP code** in the verification form
2. **Form submits via AJAX** (no page reload)
3. **Loading state** is shown during verification
4. **If successful:**
   - Success modal appears with message
   - User can click "Go to Login" or wait 3 seconds
   - Automatic redirect to login page
5. **If error:**
   - Error toast notification appears
   - Form is re-enabled for retry
   - User can try again

## Testing

### Test Coverage
Created comprehensive tests in `tests/Feature/OtpVerificationTest.php`:

1. **Form Display Test:** Verifies OTP verification page loads correctly
2. **Modal Script Test:** Ensures success modal JavaScript is included
3. **Modal Utilities Test:** Verifies modal utilities script is loaded
4. **Login Page Test:** Confirms login page can display success messages

### Test Results
```

```

## Technical Details
