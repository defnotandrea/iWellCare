## How to Use These ERDs

### Option 1: Online PlantUML Viewer
1. Copy the content of any `.puml` file
2. Visit [PlantUML Online Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)
3. Paste the content and view the diagram

### Option 2: VS Code Extension
1. Install the "PlantUML" extension in VS Code
2. Open any `.puml` file
3. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` and run "PlantUML: Preview Current Diagram"

### Option 3: Local PlantUML Installation
1. Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
2. Install PlantUML JAR file
3. Run: `java -jar plantuml.jar iWellCare_ERD.puml`

### Option 4: Command Line (if PlantUML is installed)
```bash
plantuml iWellCare_ERD.puml
plantuml iWellCare_ERD_Simplified.puml
```

## Database Schema Highlights

### Core Tables
- **users**: Central user management with role-based access
- **doctors**: Extended doctor profiles and specializations
- **patients**: Patient demographics and medical information
- **appointments**: Scheduling and appointment tracking
- **consultations**: Medical consultation documentation
- **prescriptions**: Medication prescription management
- **medical_records**: Comprehensive health record storage
- **inventory**: Medical supply and equipment management
- **invoices**: Financial billing and payment tracking

### Supporting Tables
- **otp_codes**: Two-factor authentication
- **doctor_availability_settings**: Doctor scheduling
- **prescription_medications**: Detailed medication instructions
- **inventory_logs**: Stock movement tracking
- **sessions**: User session management
- **notifications**: System notifications
- **failed_jobs**: Background job failure tracking

## Business Logic

### Appointment Workflow
1. Patient books appointment
2. Staff confirms appointment
3. Doctor conducts consultation
4. Consultation generates medical records
5. Prescriptions are created if needed
6. Invoice is generated for billing

### User Role Hierarchy
- **Admin**: Full system access
- **Staff**: Patient management, scheduling, billing
- **Doctor**: Patient care, prescriptions, medical records
- **Patient**: Appointment booking, record viewing

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity
- Soft deletes preserve historical data
- Audit trails track all changes
- Role-based access control ensures security

## Technical Specifications

### Database Engine
- **Primary**: MySQL/MariaDB
- **Compatible**: PostgreSQL, SQLite

### Framework
- **Backend**: Laravel (PHP)
- **Frontend**: Blade templates with Bootstrap
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum

### Data Types
- **Primary Keys**: Auto-incrementing bigint
- **Timestamps**: Laravel standard created_at/updated_at
- **JSON Fields**: For flexible data storage (arrays, objects)
- **Enums**: For status and type fields

## Maintenance Notes

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor inventory levels and reorder points
- Review and archive old medical records
- Clean up expired OTP codes
- Audit user access and permissions
