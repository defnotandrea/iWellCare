To use Gmail SMTP, update your `.env` file with:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=gmail
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="iWellCare Healthcare System"
```

### 2. Gmail App Password Setup
1. Enable 2-Step Verification on your Google account
2. Generate an App Password for "Mail"
3. Use the 16-character app password in your .env file

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Email Configuration
```bash
php artisan test:email
```

### 2. Test with Specific Appointment
```bash
php artisan test:email {appointment_id}
```

### 3. Check Logs
Monitor `storage/logs/laravel.log` for detailed information about email sending attempts.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Staff confirms appointment** → Status changes to "confirmed"
2. **Email notification sent** → Patient receives confirmation email
3. **Success feedback** → Staff sees confirmation message
4. **Error handling** → If email fails, staff is notified but appointment is still confirmed
5. **Comprehensive logging** → All actions are logged for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Gmail authentication failed**: Check app password and 2FA settings
2. **Connection timeout**: Verify port 587 is not blocked
3. **Patient not found**: Check database relationships between appointments, patients, and users
4. **User has no email**: Verify patient user accounts have valid email addresses

### Debug Steps
1. Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
2. Test email configuration: `php artisan test:email`
3. Verify database relationships
4. Check Gmail app password settings

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Gmail SMTP** using the provided guide
2. **Test the system** with a real appointment confirmation
3. **Monitor logs** for any remaining issues
4. **Verify email delivery** to patients
